# Overview

This work aims to design and implement a **storage engine** for **persistent** objects in a data store. It builds on prior efforts (__TaYo__) on data store (engine and store) for immutable objects. Through persistent objects, the engine should support multiple versions of a given object in the store. Furthermore, while storing objects on disk, we intend to bypass traditional (distributed) file system interfaces and write straight to the secondary devices.
