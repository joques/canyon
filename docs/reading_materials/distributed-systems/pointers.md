# Consensus and replication

+ Consensus in the cloud: Paxos systems demystified (Ailijiang, Charapko and Demirbas)
+ WormSpace: A modular foundation for simple, verifiable distributed systems (Shin and Kim)
+ In search of an understandable consensus algorithm (Ongaro and Ousterhout)

# Logical Clocks

+ Lamport timestamp and vector clock
+ Google True Time
+ Hybrid Logical Clock
