# Description

provide a short description of the research project

A [data store] storage engine is an internal software component that a data store uses to store, read, update and delete data in the underlying memory and storage system.

# Key Features

list all features here
data model could be key-value store or document
persistent objects
versioning (strengthening collaboration)

# Topics

short description of the topics involved in this research

data structures: LSM and B-Trees (including B+Trees)

a few DFS: Gluster FS, HDFS, BeeGFS, Lustre

write-ahead log and write-through cache

storage devices (raw devices) and how to write straight to devices

# Storage Engines
